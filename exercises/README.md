# Exercises

I will upload the exercises on Monday shortly after the lecture at the latest.

As discussed in the lecture, 
- just upload your solutions to a private git-repo (for example github). 
- one folder per week is good
- add me as a collaborator so I can view it
- please do so until Monday 9:45 of to following week (so before the lecture)

Grading
- 66% of all exercises need to be solved to pass the course

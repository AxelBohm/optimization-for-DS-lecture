# Exercises

I will upload the exercises on Monday shortly after the lecture at the latest.

## Organization
As discussed in the lecture, 
- just upload your solutions to a private git-repository (for example github). 
- one folder (inside the same repo) per week is good
- please do so until Monday 9:45 of to following week (so before the lecture)
- add me as a collaborator so I can view it

The first two digits in the name of the folder correspond to the week they are supposed to be done in (starting at 1).

## Grading
- 66% of all points are required to pass the course
- every week will be around 10 points

## Python

In case you are unsure from where to install, I recommend the Anaconda (or miniconda) distribution.

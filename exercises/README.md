# Exercises

I will upload the exercises on Monday shortly after the lecture at the latest.

## Organization
As discussed in the lecture, 
- Just upload your solutions to a private git-repository (for example github). 
- One folder (inside the same repo) per week is good
- Please do so until Monday 9:45 of to following week (so before the lecture) if not otherwise specified in the README of the corresponding folder.
- Add me as a collaborator so I can view it.
- Add a README where you state the number points (out of ten) you did.
  + If you did all the exercises you should award yourself 10/10 (even if not everything might be completely correct).
  + If you skip one week you'll get 0 (if you end up doing them after the deadline you can still upload them and award yourself 50%).
  + For anything in between, if I haven't explicitly specified which task gives you how many points, just estimate (interpolate).

The first two digits in the name of the folder correspond to the week they are supposed to be done in (starting at 1).

## Grading
- 66% of all points are required to pass the course
- every week will be 10 points

## Python

In case you are unsure from where to install, I recommend the Anaconda (or miniconda) distribution.
